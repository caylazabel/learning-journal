#Class 10

This last week was stressful, to say the least. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I broke my code. It was exhausting. I worked through literally every line of code to get it figured out. I've learned to ACP often. Very often. Salmon cookies are done! I'm so happy. I need to work on wire framing some more. I thought I was better at CSS than I really am.
