#Class 01

today was the first day of class and we already learned a lot! Most of it was housekeeping things we went over in class that needed to get out of the way. I started learning about the command line, which is helpful because I didn't know what everything did. Commands are SO helpful, too! I'm so happy for all the commands. Creating new files, and folders and directories. I'm excited for this class. I think it'll be a rough ride but I think it'll go well! Next week, I gotta say I'm nervous about.
