#Class 11

Today we worked on charts and canvas API's. I haven't totally grasped everything yet but I'm sure with repetition and practice it will get easier. Having the ability to use data from libraries to render your chart is nice, it really makes things easier. Buss mall is basically done, just finishing the last few parts of the assignment. Today was definitely easier than yesterday so that makes me feel good. Progress is progress regardless of how slow it may feel. I'm not trying to think of good ideas for my elevator pitch and project ideas.
Things are getting easier, I'm happy about it.
