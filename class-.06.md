#Class 06

Whew! Today was intense. I spent 10 hours on campus today, that was cool. I was able to get everything I needed to done, however which felt good. Week two is off to a good start. It was hard.
Today, I was able to get through it all except when I had to print the sum of all cookies sold that day. I for some reason got lost in my code and couldn't figure out how to get past it. With some help from Sam and others, I pulled through and FINALLY printed the sum on to the browser page below all the numbers.
The rest wasn't easy but easier, that's for sure. I am excited to see where tomorrow takes me, as well. lol this will be a fun project.
