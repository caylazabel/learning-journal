#Class 08

Well, today I at least got my code to work and run. Yesterday was horrible, to say the least. It was overwhelming because I had my code working from Monday and then as soon as I tried to add the constructor function, it broke and broke pretty bad to the point where I had to start over. Anyways, I then today was able to submit it and have some TA's look over it. I was very close to getting my code to the point where it needed to be to run and render a table with data onto the webpage. When it came time to doing lab today, I took my feedback and what Sam talked about in class and really tried to move things around and make it run. FINALLY it ran and my table appeared full of data. I had to add a simple header into the table with time slots on it for the cookie stores.
After I got everything working, I pushed it up to github and moved forward. I was able to start the lab that we were suppose to do today, but I didn't quite finish and I wasn't going to allow myself to stay til 9:30 again tonight to make things work. I'm understanding things and that's what matters.
