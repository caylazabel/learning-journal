#Class 03

Today in class we learned more about github and the git process. Pair programming was something we went over today, and that has been interesting to say the least. My partner and I ran into a problem, and ended up having a merge error. We asked some questions and were able to figure some things out. My partner Brian had to make another git remote called upstream which allowed him to access a newer version of my code to fork than he had forked previously. It was a frustrating day but I'm glad we got everything figured out.
I still need to work on git commands because I still have to look them up in my notes to make sure I'm doing them right. I know it will come with practice but it does get frustrating sometimes.
