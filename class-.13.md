Today I finally got stuff done and working. It took a while to get everything to work but I understand why it wasn't working and got it figured out. The chart works and I added CSS. It doesn't look perfect but it works I guess. I could always go back later and work on it. I'm glad we were introduced to local storage, that is useful and it's not a very hard concept to understand.
